The fields in reviews.csv are:
● location_id: an id identifying which location this review is about.
● review_id: an id unique to each review.
● date: the date the review was left
● rating: the rating of the review between 1 and 5 where 5 is the best possible rating.
● comment: the text content of the review.

An approach is to be implemented to identify one word that seem to best
“describe” each location (taken from reviews about this location) as opposed to
the other locations in the data set.
